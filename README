    num_imgs is the number of images to display from each directory.
    files_list is a list of the files in each directory.
    image is the current image being displayed.
    m is the index of the current image.

Functions:

    os.walk() is used to recursively iterate through the directories.
    mpimg.imread() is used to read an image from a file.
    plt.subplot() is used to create a subplot in a grid.
